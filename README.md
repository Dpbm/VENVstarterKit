## How to create a module

1. Go to starter.sh and add a new echo line to your module and add your package manager name to types list. Ex:

```bash
    after:
        echo "anaconda [1]"
        echo "pipenv   [2]"
        echo "venv     [3]"
        echo "poetry   [4]"
        echo "exit     [0]"

        types=(anaconda pipenv venv poetry)

    before:
        echo "anaconda [1]"
        echo "pipenv   [2]"
        echo "venv     [3]"
        echo "poetry   [4]"
        echo "pip      [5]"
        echo "exit     [0]"

        types=(anaconda pipenv venv poetry pip)

```

2. add a folder to your module in modules folder (with the same name of you putted on starter.sh types list)

3. in this folder add main.sh file and add your commands like this

```bash
    # header to check if package manager is installed, you can use or not
    clear
    if [ ! $(which virtualenv) ]
    then
        echo "You need to install virtualenv and add to your path"
        exit
    fi

    # options to choice
    echo "what's your environment type?"
    echo "data science [0]"
    echo "math         [1]"
    echo "security     [2]"
    echo "web          [3]"
    echo "test         [4]"

    read envType

    types=(data math security web test) 

    # commands to install dependencies in the current project
    source bin/activate
    pip install -r ~/anacondaStarterKit/modules/pipenv/types/${types[$envType]}.txt
```
